Only iPad 2, iPad Air available
Apple just named it iPad Air to merge their adwords keywords #adwords #apple #ipad #ipadair
iPad Air is nice, but is it that much nicer than my iPad 3? It does look different.  
iPad air? No touch id, still 16 gig base after 5 years, still selling the iPad 2.   No thank you #AppleKeynote #applefail
iPad Air looks impressive.   #iPadAir
Apple to bring out new IPad Air, which weighs one pound
Started making iPad Air years ago.  shit, god knows what crazy stuff they're building now for release in a few years time!! 
I'm in love with the iPad Air, I'm just saying. I jumped to the mini because the big one was too fat &amp; heavy. No longer!
@nbc6: #BREAKING: Apple has debuted its new iPad Air, it says it thinner, lighter and faster than the previous model http://t.co/WZw9DE0emx
need an iPad Air  somebody buy mine off me?
And Apple just killed any chance of widespread success with the cost of the iPad Air. iPad isn't a laptop replacement, it's an add-on
#AppleEvent, new iPad now called iPad Air! Why? Has the new A7 chip. $499

iPad Air.   I like what I hear!
iPad Air is AMAZING! #TEAMAPPLE
Ouch, my credit card. Probably going to be buying an iPad mini, iPad Air, and retina MacBook Pro.
The iPad Air basically addresses every problem I had with the never-shrinking size of the main iPad, + a better FaceTime cam than my phone.
iPad Air.  that's funny.  
iPad mini retina has same res as the iPad air.
Scratch that. I want an iPad Mini with Retina instead of the iPad Air.
iPad air I am going to own u, faster fly to my place.
@macrumorslive: 7.9-inches, 2048x1536 pixels, same as the iPad Air. "The experience is just amazing." Insane!
OMG, SO getting an iPad Air

iPad mini and iPad Air share exactly the same resolution.
