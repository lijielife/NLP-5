iPad air is sick
 @macrumorslive: "When you hold it, it will be a dramatically different experience."  Translation: new iPad Air is a bit lighter.
The iPad Air will free your wallet of money.?  
The ipad air looks like the ipad mini. 
I really wanted a Touchscreen iMac to be announced today. #lesight  Guess the new iPad Air will suffice.
iPad Air doesn't look like anything new
Not gonna lie, that iPad air looks sick. @shamron137
You planned ahead well  I should have really, but I'll admit, I wasn't expecting something as amazing as the iPad Air!

After going through Baudrillard &amp; consumer culture in a Postmodern Culture I'm like,  I'm aware now. Objects don't define me . BUT IPAD AIR!

iPad Air + OS X Maverick (free)  
Interesting thought     @apollozac: Mac mini, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro.  iPad mini, iPad Air, iPad.  Fill in the blank. 
someone just told me they announced a iPad air sounds interesting
Wtf do "IPAD AIR" do that the regular "IPAD" don't?
Hot off the presses Info on the "iPad Air" http://t.co/QBoxOwb7Xq
Well, quite surprised at the OS X Mavericks completely free. Also, iPad Air looks rather nice, if you like that sort of thing. 
#promisetoself Won't buy the new iPad Air
IPad 4 vs iPad air. Basically you are paying for a slightly faster and smaller device. How innovative can apple get?
So I want the new iPad Air abd wouldn't mind a new mac pro. Can't believe mavericks is free, looks like I need to get saving lol #apple #new

Another, probable pointless tablet, the iPad air

New tabs from Apple are the iPad Mini Retina and iPad Air. But where is my iPad Pro?!?!
So Apple had 1yr to catch up and still couldn't launch a touchscreen MacBook. iPad Air was nice at least. #justgetawin8tablet
The new iPad air looks decent
Apple just released the iPad Air. Thank god cause my current iPad is so heavy I was actually close to getting first world arthritis!
iPad air has just been added to the Christmas list  
iPad Air? Seriously   the regular iPad isn't heavy at all to begin with
Yes; does the non-cellular iPad Air have GPS capabilities? No spec found on site. (Old iPads only had GPS on cellular models IIRC.)
Who's getting the new iPad Air or mini.!?! 
Lumia 2520 @DURTYJOEY: $500 for the new iPad Air? lol.  Microsoft Surface here i come
