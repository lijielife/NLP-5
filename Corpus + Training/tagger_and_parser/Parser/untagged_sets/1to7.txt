New iPad called iPad Air, weight one pound.
They've renamed the iPad 'iPad Air' #AppleKeynote
IPAD AIR WHAAAAAT #AppleEvent
iPad Air weighs in at just 1 lbs.
The all new ipad air is amazing!
iPad Air weighs 450 grams, down from 640. That is a selling point for me. (3rd gen iPad is too heavy to hold comfortably while reading.)
1 lb. lightest full size tablet in the world. iPad Air
I want the new iPad Air and Mac Pro
Welcome, iPad Air. Not bad at all.
iPad Air.  Breathtaking.
A pound. iPad Air. But i see no Touch ID. Is an iPad Pro next?
iPad Air, because why not change the name again?
iPad Air!!!!!!
And I will call him Mini me  oh, sorry  iPad Air.  No word on its performance being frisbee'd across the room.
LMFAO iPad air WELL DONE #apple
omg! Ipad air!!!!!!!!!! Thinner n lighter!
IPad Mini your days are number. iPad Air you will be mine!
Why don't I have an iPad Air yet? Uncool.
#iPad Air. http://t.co/BAGUv0504b

The new iPad Air is now filled with helium to make it even lighter
iPad Air is a dumb name unless they are going to keep making thick ones too. #justipad
I want an iPad Air lol
The new iPad Air weighs as much as one pound of air
the iPad air. really?

OK iPad air - now i'm listening
iPad Air  baby!
New iPad is called iPad air and it only weighs 1 pound!!! http://t.co/I9UqeqYonk
The new IPad is IPad Air! Awesome! #AppleEvent
The iPad Air Pro will be iPaP @mollywood  #cnetlive
IPad air? I'll reserve judgement till android 4.4 Kitkat is released.
iPad Air has A7.  Which means it has the secure enclave.  Which means it could have Touch ID.
iPad Air has the new 64-bit A7 chip, M7 motion co-processor. 72x faster graphics than iPad 1.
iPad Air !!!! #apple. Gotta admit when they first came out I was sceptical.   Sometimes it's good to be wrong.   #genius
It was an iPad Air.
Will there be a trade in program where I can trade in my iPad for the new iPad Air? I wants it!!
It's the iPad Air it blows everything away like air does  #AAPL
Want a iPad Air!
If there is an iPad Air then there will be an iPad Pro coming up! #CNETLive
OMG I  am so buying the new iPad Air!!!iPad air #eh
I see no mention of iPad Air with 32GB or 64GB, only 16GB.strange
iPad Air.  Next time iPad Fire
iPad Air? Really? I could almost see people in the audience forcing themselves not to laugh.   #AppleKeynote
Does the new iPad Air has airplane mode?
iPad Air not iPad S, Johnny. Lol #apple
@jdisis lol no I meant the idea of an iPad air. How is this that much diff from the iPad I already have???
iPad Air.  kinda like Will Smith's gun in MIB.  "Feel like I'm gonna break this damn thing" #apple #ipad #ipadair
I shouldn't watch these Apple events!!  Now I want an iPad Air!!!
iPad Air - 5th Generation of iPad! #Apple #iPadAir
Only iPad 2, iPad Air available
Apple just named it iPad Air to merge their adwords keywords #adwords #apple #ipad #ipadair
iPad Air is nice, but is it that much nicer than my iPad 3? It does look different.  
iPad air? No touch id, still 16 gig base after 5 years, still selling the iPad 2.   No thank you #AppleKeynote #applefail
iPad Air looks impressive.   #iPadAir
Apple to bring out new IPad Air, which weighs one pound
Started making iPad Air years ago.  shit, god knows what crazy stuff they're building now for release in a few years time!! 
I'm in love with the iPad Air, I'm just saying. I jumped to the mini because the big one was too fat &amp; heavy. No longer!
@nbc6: #BREAKING: Apple has debuted its new iPad Air, it says it thinner, lighter and faster than the previous model http://t.co/WZw9DE0emx
need an iPad Air  somebody buy mine off me?
And Apple just killed any chance of widespread success with the cost of the iPad Air. iPad isn't a laptop replacement, it's an add-on
#AppleEvent, new iPad now called iPad Air! Why? Has the new A7 chip. $499
@lucasbraga iPad Air!!!!
I thought the iPad Air was the new iPad Mini?
iPad Air you skinny bitch!!
iPad Air! #Apple
iPad Mini, iPad Air, iPad Vente Its 20 inches long, so it makes sense
@MRJCONSULTING09 what is the iPad air?? #bcamp13
iPad air is the stupidest name I've heard
I'm a pretty big fan of the iPad Air.
iPad Air.   I like what I hear!
iPad Air is AMAZING! #TEAMAPPLE
Ouch, my credit card. Probably going to be buying an iPad mini, iPad Air, and retina MacBook Pro.
The iPad Air basically addresses every problem I had with the never-shrinking size of the main iPad, + a better FaceTime cam than my phone.
iPad Air.  that's funny.  
iPad mini retina has same res as the iPad air.
Scratch that. I want an iPad Mini with Retina instead of the iPad Air.
iPad air I am going to own u, faster fly to my place.
@macrumorslive: 7.9-inches, 2048x1536 pixels, same as the iPad Air. "The experience is just amazing." Insane!
OMG, SO getting an iPad Air
iPad Air!
iPad mini and iPad Air share exactly the same resolution.
The iPad Air?! 
Ipad Air.   Hehehe lemme guess this is to rival Samsung Note 3
as well rename the iPad mini  iPad Air Mini
iPad Air http://t.co/UR6UsPazuY
Oh new iPad Mini or IPad Air?
iPad Air Bud: There's no rule saying a dog can't use a tablet
My God iPad Air namanya. Wow. Tebel cuma 7,5mm [pic]  https://t.co/oVjEVJW4Hg
There's gonna be an iPad Air #Whaaaaat #PreOrderwas very improbable to start with. I was hoping for an "iPad Pro" once they announced the iPad Air sigh
So,  iPad Air  and  iPhone 5c  are the new categories Tim Cook was talking about?
Loved the event even more than I expected. T-10 days until I hopefully own a new iPad Air.
One iPad Air please.
I want an iPad air.  #AppleEvent
iPad Air? What a waste of money. adds iPad Air to Christmas list #appletramp
iPad air is fantastic,new mini is running 64bit processing too so will run real smooth
So about this iPad Air....I'm about to buy the previous iPad. #AppleKeynote
Why did Apple rename the iPad to iPad Air? Thought there might be an iPad Pro 
It was a joke to just me in which I thought,  500.00?! Long hair, iPad Air   Pretty pathetic, honestly. #LongHairiPadAir
But whatever. I guess I could buy the iPad Air and then sell it when new iPad minis are announced.
the iPad air is stunning!! Although I have a soft spot for the iPad mini with Retina #Geek
No pre-porders for iPad Air? 
iPad line up. Keeping the iPad 2 (can't see the point) and the original Mini The new iPad 5 to be called iPad Air http://t.co/LOJqCpVg8K
Trend Alert: 'iPad Air'. More trends at http://t.co/3ZpGNCIaQz #trndnl http://t.co/GH5bP6qBmh
In bed with the new iPad Air, being hit in the nose is no longer a concern. #fb
if they don't already have iPad airs why are they your friends?
Slightly underwhelmed by new iPad announcements. iPad Air is a cool name, but it's iPad Mini with Retina that appeals.
iPad air
To make up for working Christmas Day I may have to buy myself an iPad air  
Amazing iPad Air http://t.co/ERlpxd9des    
Where is the iPad Air   [pic]   https://t.co/KClMbapxGD
I guess, but what comes next year? iPad Air 2?
Ohh jesus, want and need everything announced during the last hour. iPad Air. YES! I think it would also iron your clothes if you asked it
Comfortly watching the Apple event at home with a beer. advantages of being on this side of the ocean. Amazing iPad Air!!!
New iPad Air look pretty cool
BBC News - Apple shows off thinner iPad Air http://t.co/BmzGkQ7dhZ  #ipad #apple

"@DarrenCriss: Mmmmm new iPad Air. Nom nom gimme gimme  #Apple" #geek

iPad Air!
Disappointed there's no new Apple TV. iPad Air looks nice but can't help but feel that tech innovation delivery is being cautiously managed
I'll wait until Black Friday to get the iPad air. Well, I'll try and wait
Apple shows off thinner iPad Air http://t.co/IQ4uQ9uhZG #business #marketing
iPad Air looks neat and all but it's not a difference maker much like the 5s/5c arent either. Apples innovation unfortunately died with Jobs
      Apple:  iPad Air: http://t.co/jvOTbSV25o  The New iPad Mini: http://t.co/9WlLNWJNNL 
iPad air
Ipad air the first and only thing Apple announced this year that I wanted
The biggest deal now is iPad Air or iPad mini?
Apple announce brand new iPad Air &amp; iPad Mini with Retina DisplayiPad air?.  LOL
iPad air is sick
 @macrumorslive: "When you hold it, it will be a dramatically different experience."  Translation: new iPad Air is a bit lighter.
The iPad Air will free your wallet of money.?  
The ipad air looks like the ipad mini. 
I really wanted a Touchscreen iMac to be announced today. #lesight  Guess the new iPad Air will suffice.
iPad Air doesn't look like anything new
Not gonna lie, that iPad air looks sick. @shamron137
You planned ahead well  I should have really, but I'll admit, I wasn't expecting something as amazing as the iPad Air!

Interesting thought     @apollozac: Mac mini, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro.  iPad mini, iPad Air, iPad.  Fill in the blank. 
someone just told me they announced a iPad air sounds interesting
Wtf do "IPAD AIR" do that the regular "IPAD" don't?
Hot off the presses Info on the "iPad Air" http://t.co/QBoxOwb7Xq
Well, quite surprised at the OS X Mavericks completely free. Also, iPad Air looks rather nice, if you like that sort of thing. 
#promisetoself Won't buy the new iPad Air
IPad 4 vs iPad air. Basically you are paying for a slightly faster and smaller device. How innovative can apple get?
So I want the new iPad Air abd wouldn't mind a new mac pro. Can't believe mavericks is free, looks like I need to get saving lol #apple #new
ipad air deve ser bom ein
iPad Air? Don't care.

New tabs from Apple are the iPad Mini Retina and iPad Air. But where is my iPad Pro?!?!
So Apple had 1yr to catch up and still couldn't launch a touchscreen MacBook. iPad Air was nice at least. #justgetawin8tablet
The new iPad air looks decent
Apple just released the iPad Air. Thank god cause my current iPad is so heavy I was actually close to getting first world arthritis!
iPad air has just been added to the Christmas list  
iPad Air? Seriously   the regular iPad isn't heavy at all to begin with
Yes; does the non-cellular iPad Air have GPS capabilities? No spec found on site. (Old iPads only had GPS on cellular models IIRC.)
Who's getting the new iPad Air or mini.!?! 
Lumia 2520 @DURTYJOEY: $500 for the new iPad Air? lol.  Microsoft Surface here i comeiPad Air, some predicted it would be the iPad mini's name a year ago.
The iPad Air ad is on par with Don Draper's Kodak Carousel pitch. One of best ads Apple's ever done.
New iPad. iPad air. Nice,nice. Another reason to become rich. Hard keeping up with apple product without 
daughters dilemma, iPad mini retina 32gb or iPad air 16gb both 399.  Which is is it to be, screen size or memory? #help
Hmm.  Should I get the new iPad mini or the iPad air?
Macbook Pro Retinas (13 and 15) Mac Pro, iPad Air, iPad Mini w/ Retina, Mavericks (OSX 10.9), iOS 7.0.3.

iPad Air? Apple just continues trying to manufacture needs. Seems as unnecessary as the iPad Mini.
I must say, I'm sorely tempted by the iPad Air. Weight has always been an issue for tablets, but this should settle it. CC @brokenbottleboy
