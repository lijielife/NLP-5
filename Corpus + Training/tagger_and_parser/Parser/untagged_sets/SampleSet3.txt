was very improbable to start with. I was hoping for an "iPad Pro" once they announced the iPad Air sigh
So,  iPad Air  and  iPhone 5c  are the new categories Tim Cook was talking about?
Loved the event even more than I expected. T-10 days until I hopefully own a new iPad Air.
One iPad Air please.
I want an iPad air.  #AppleEvent
iPad Air? What a waste of money. adds iPad Air to Christmas list #appletramp
iPad air is fantastic,new mini is running 64bit processing too so will run real smooth
So about this iPad Air....I'm about to buy the previous iPad. #AppleKeynote
Why did Apple rename the iPad to iPad Air? Thought there might be an iPad Pro 
It was a joke to just me in which I thought,  500.00?! Long hair, iPad Air   Pretty pathetic, honestly. #LongHairiPadAir
But whatever. I guess I could buy the iPad Air and then sell it when new iPad minis are announced.
the iPad air is stunning!! Although I have a soft spot for the iPad mini with Retina #Geek
No pre-porders for iPad Air?

In bed with the new iPad Air, being hit in the nose is no longer a concern. #fb
if they don't already have iPad airs why are they your friends?
Slightly underwhelmed by new iPad announcements. iPad Air is a cool name, but it's iPad Mini with Retina that appeals.

To make up for working Christmas Day I may have to buy myself an iPad air

iPad Air!
Disappointed there's no new Apple TV. iPad Air looks nice but can't help but feel that tech innovation delivery is being cautiously managed
I'll wait until Black Friday to get the iPad air. Well, I'll try and wait

iPad Air looks neat and all but it's not a difference maker much like the 5s/5c arent either. Apples innovation unfortunately died with Jobs
