IPAD AIR WHAAAAAT #AppleEvent
iPad Air weighs in at just 1 lbs.
The all new ipad air is amazing!
iPad Air weighs 450 grams, down from 640. That is a selling point for me. (3rd gen iPad is too heavy to hold comfortably while reading.)
1 lb. lightest full size tablet in the world. iPad Air
I want the new iPad Air and Mac Pro
Welcome, iPad Air. Not bad at all.
iPad Air.  Breathtaking.
A pound. iPad Air. But i see no Touch ID. Is an iPad Pro next?

The new IPad is IPad Air! Awesome! #AppleEvent
The iPad Air Pro will be iPaP @mollywood  #cnetlive
IPad air? I'll reserve judgement till android 4.4 Kitkat is released.
iPad Air has A7.  Which means it has the secure enclave.  Which means it could have Touch ID.
iPad Air has the new 64-bit A7 chip, M7 motion co-processor. 72x faster graphics than iPad 1.
iPad Air !!!! #apple. Gotta admit when they first came out I was sceptical.   Sometimes it's good to be wrong.   #genius
It was an iPad Air.
Will there be a trade in program where I can trade in my iPad for the new iPad Air? I wants it!!
It's the iPad Air it blows everything away like air does  #AAPL
Want a iPad Air!
If there is an iPad Air then there will be an iPad Pro coming up! #CNETLive
OMG I  am so buying the new iPad Air!!!iPad air #eh
I see no mention of iPad Air with 32GB or 64GB, only 16GB.strange
iPad Air.  Next time iPad Fire
iPad Air? Really? I could almost see people in the audience forcing themselves not to laugh.   #AppleKeynote
Does the new iPad Air has airplane mode?
iPad Air not iPad S, Johnny. Lol #apple
@jdisis lol no I meant the idea of an iPad air. How is this that much diff from the iPad I already have???
iPad Air.  kinda like Will Smith's gun in MIB.  "Feel like I'm gonna break this damn thing" #apple #ipad #ipadair
I shouldn't watch these Apple events!!  Now I want an iPad Air!!!
iPad Air - 5th Generation of iPad! #Apple #iPadAir
Only iPad 2, iPad Air available
Apple just named it iPad Air to merge their adwords keywords #adwords #apple #ipad #ipadair
iPad Air is nice, but is it that much nicer than my iPad 3? It does look different.  
iPad air? No touch id, still 16 gig base after 5 years, still selling the iPad 2.   No thank you #AppleKeynote #applefail
iPad Air looks impressive.   #iPadAir
Apple to bring out new IPad Air, which weighs one pound
Started making iPad Air years ago.  shit, god knows what crazy stuff they're building now for release in a few years time!! 
I'm in love with the iPad Air, I'm just saying. I jumped to the mini because the big one was too fat &amp; heavy. No longer!
@nbc6: #BREAKING: Apple has debuted its new iPad Air, it says it thinner, lighter and faster than the previous model http://t.co/WZw9DE0emx
need an iPad Air  somebody buy mine off me?
And Apple just killed any chance of widespread success with the cost of the iPad Air. iPad isn't a laptop replacement, it's an add-on
#AppleEvent, new iPad now called iPad Air! Why? Has the new A7 chip. $499
@lucasbraga iPad Air!!!!
I thought the iPad Air was the new iPad Mini?

iPad Mini, iPad Air, iPad Vente Its 20 inches long, so it makes sense
@MRJCONSULTING09 what is the iPad air?? #bcamp13
iPad air is the stupidest name I've heard
I'm a pretty big fan of the iPad Air.
iPad Air.   I like what I hear!
iPad Air is AMAZING! #TEAMAPPLE
Ouch, my credit card. Probably going to be buying an iPad mini, iPad Air, and retina MacBook Pro.
The iPad Air basically addresses every problem I had with the never-shrinking size of the main iPad, + a better FaceTime cam than my phone.
iPad Air.  that's funny.  
iPad mini retina has same res as the iPad air.
Scratch that. I want an iPad Mini with Retina instead of the iPad Air.
iPad air I am going to own u, faster fly to my place.
@macrumorslive: 7.9-inches, 2048x1536 pixels, same as the iPad Air. "The experience is just amazing." Insane!
OMG, SO getting an iPad Air
iPad Air!
iPad mini and iPad Air share exactly the same resolution.
The iPad Air?! 
Ipad Air.   Hehehe lemme guess this is to rival Samsung Note 3
as well rename the iPad mini  iPad Air Mini
iPad Air http://t.co/UR6UsPazuY
