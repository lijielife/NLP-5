iPad Air (5th Gen) &amp; New iPad Mini with Retina Display.   https://t.co/CgktQmVeKn
Hmm.
seems that I can't decide which iPad I want since Apple unveiled them this morning. 
The iPad Air or the iPad Mini?? 
I can't decide.  
Welcome iPad Air &amp; iPad mini 2!
iPad Air on T-Mobile has 200 MB per month for free.
so tempted to get the new iPad air  
Hmm.

The iPad Air or the iPad Mini?? 
Help!!  
#ipad air - shut up and take my money!!!
In any case, I'll be on a road trip when the iPad Air drops. 
Could buy, but would have mobile migration issues. 
It can wait 'til I'm home.
iPad Air, I love You  
iPad Air!
I know - they seemed way too stilted and nervous for those announcements  
Think the iPad Air name is unnecessary as well.
Soooo will there be a 64gb iPad Air, or does it only come in 16GB?
If so, then that's stupid. 
for me calling it an iPad Air makes complete sense, it's an evolution of the macbook air at this stage #ipadair #Applekeynote
Apple #iPad Air http://t.co/CLOj5YHP69
Its 00:00 IST And what I can see in my mob twitter app Apple iPad Air is trending, prices start at $499 for the 16GB WiFi edition.

Torn between the iPad mini with Retina Display and the iPad Air
I think the iPad Air is going to be the first iPad I'm going to skip. 
Just will go for the mini retina.
"iPad Air" leaves scope for an "iPad Pro".

iPad Air! 
That's looks nice! (No touch ID) 
iPad mini with retina is  320, iPad mini now  250, iPad air normal price
The new name for the full-size iPad.  
iPad Air  A total disappointment. 
No Touch ID on either iPad model.
iPad Air: faster, with not enough memory to hold all of Apple's built-in apps in the base model. 
Sheesh.
Thinner, lighter and more powerful than ever before" the new iPad.

New iPad Air noticeably lighter. 
From 1.4lbs to 1lb. http://t.co/wBDBzlCyz1
Finally, I LOVE the concept of the iPad Air's ad and how they showcased it's thinness!

Honestly, the only thing that excited me about the #AppleEvent was the iPad Air name.

iPad Air front camera upgrade = better selfies
Upon first hearing of the iPad air I was disappointed that theres a screen &amp; that I couldnt magically navigate via hologram Boo apple
The iPad Air is 72 times faster than the iPad 4? 
I didn't think you could get any faster than instantly fast, but okay. 
I noticed all the same things.
I also don't recall anyone leaking the iPad Air name beforehand, so that was a surprise as well.
first class? 
I can't afford an iPad Air mate!!!!
iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina are 7.5mm in depth. 
The original mini is 7.2mm in depth.

The new iPad air looks so good #apple #ipadair http://t.co/qasdeBkhSM
@rossrubin: Mavericks is free.
