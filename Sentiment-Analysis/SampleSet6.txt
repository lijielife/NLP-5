I am kindly accepting iPad Air as gifts for Xmas. #FYI

@iBoxIndonesia Ipad Mini with Retina Display &amp; Ipad Air #iBoxQuiz
iPad Air? Apple just continues trying to manufacture needs. Seems as unnecessary as the iPad Mini.
I must say, I'm sorely tempted by the iPad Air. Weight has always been an issue for tablets, but this should settle it. CC @brokenbottleboy

#SAPTechEd and #Apple keynotes at the same time. I think my twitter client is going to explode. Fair chance that my brain will go as well.
Always exciting for a nerd when there is an Apple event... #Apple
So excited for the #AppleEvent that I'm biting my tongue and hurting my jaw
I don't see why #apple should release an #iWatch right now. Think tech is not this developed, that it'll make sense to sell half things.
